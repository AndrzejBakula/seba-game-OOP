# seba-game (Object Oriented Programmin Version)
Simple rpg-parody game written using python (pygame). This is new version of my first major project "Seba". This time I changed the way the code is written, using object-oriented programming methods.

## How to play "Seba"?
Just fork and clone repository, or download all files, and run game1.py using python. You will need python3 and pygame to do that.
Use arrow keys to move Seba, run away home and try to survive in the yards and streets of Wroc≈Çaw.

## Age category (PEGI 16)
Due to the presence of alcohol and drug-related content in the game, as well as morally questionable decisions made by the characters, I have determined the age category for 16 years.

Enjoy :)
