# seba-game (Object-Oriented Programming Version)
My first major project - simple rpg-parody game written using python (pygame). This is new version of "Seba" - this time I changed the way the code is written, using object-oriented programming (added moduls in separate files).

## How to play "Seba"?
Just fork and clone repository, or download all files, and run seba_oop.py using python. You will need python3 and pygame to do that.
Use arrow keys to move Seba, run away home and try to survive in the yards and streets of Wrocław.

## Age category (PEGI 16)
Due to the presence of alcohol and drug-related content in the game, as well as morally questionable decisions made by the characters, I have determined the age category for 16 years.

Enjoy :)
